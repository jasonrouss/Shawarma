# Project Rome wasn't build in one day.

### Technology used: Reactjs and Material-ui and Figma for designing the web page.

### Duration: 5 hours.


### Problems: Accidentally created two version of react in the same folder one for the main one and another for the sub folder caused the button not to function correctly.

### Solution: Re-installing the packages to a fresh new folder with the same content fixed the solution.

##Note: This is my very first project in my fullstack web journey , I combined my love for shawarma (with extra toum :p ) and my front end skills to create this project.
